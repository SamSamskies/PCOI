PCVs seek to enhance the integration of fish farming with other agricultural activities such as conservation farming, permaculture, gardening, animal husbandry, fruit trees, and agro-forestry. Since aquaculture and integrated agricultural activities are promoted as a small farm business activity, PCVs also provide training in basic business skills such as developing business plans, record keeping, marketing and financial management. As most farmers belong to aquaculture cooperatives or associations, PCVs are also involved in strengthening the organizational capacity of such local groups through providing training in aspects such as needs assessments, action planning, organizational structure, leadership and management.",,,,

This assignment focuses on teaching English Literacy to elementary school age children who speak Patwa (Jamaica’s oral language).  The Youth Literacy Advisor will use creative, student-centered strategies to ignite the love of reading, writing and comprehending English to establish and develop a strong foundation for each child’s future academic achievement. This is different than teaching a child in the US literacy and is also different than teaching English as a second language.

Given the inherent risks of travel by bush taxi, Peace Corps Togo works closely with volunteers to develop strategies that minimize the need to travel long distances. Peace Corps/Togo uses a mini-bus twice a month to transport PCVs from the northernmost city to/from Lomé.

The Liberian education system is still suffering from the effects of a prolonged civil war that forced schools to close their doors for many years. As a result the majority of students at the senior secondary level do not have the basic skills necessary to fully comprehend the content of most technical subjects such as Math and Science. Therefore, Post believes it is critical to begin placing Volunteers in junior high schools, grades 7 – 9, to teach the basic math skills that students will need in order to excel in Math and the Science classes at the senior secondary level.

Some Volunteers might have students who are much older than their peers (possibly in their early twenties). Volunteers will often teach with limited resources, including poor school infrastructure. Many students will be well below the curriculum level, due to the fact that the school system often passes students to the next level, even when students do not have the minimum skills necessary to advance to the next grade. Volunteers might have to adapt to a system where their grades are good indicators of students progress (or lack thereof), but not a determining factor in a student’s passing.

Diversity issues_x000D_
The Gambia is conservative by U.S. standards, and many Gambians disapprove of homosexuality.  Because of this, gay, lesbian, and bisexual volunteers have not been able to be open about their sexual orientation. However, Peace Corps The Gambia provides an open and supportive atmosphere for gay, lesbian, and bisexual volunteers._x000D_
_x000D_
Gambians are very welcoming and generous.  However, many, especially in the rural areas, have little knowledge of the wider world.  As a result, they often base their assumptions on very stereotypical images.  For example, they may assume that all Asian Americans are of Chinese origin, or that African Americans should understand Gambian culture or even language.  Gambian women, especially in rural areas, have very traditional roles. As a result, North American women may not be able to exercise the freedoms to which they are accustomed.  This being said, most volunteers are able to adapt to local expectations, and are happily integrated into their communities.","Must be able to bicycle long distances,May be challenging for minorities,Uneven terrain,Extreme Heat,Live with homestay family for duration of service","Primary teacher training or teaching experience preferable.

You will also work with local English teachers at your school or surrounding schools for six hours each week so that they can improve their English and learn different teaching techniques from you.

This is both an exciting time and a very challenging time in the history of Liberia. It is important for invitees to come to country with a strong commitment to public service and recognize the important of education in a post-conflict environment.

While most Volunteers will be placed with a roommate, it is important to recognize that there are fewer Volunteers in country and therefore there is a smaller network of Volunteers in their immediate area.","The project aims to support Liberia as it reconstructs its public secondary education sector. Volunteers will be teaching science in senior secondary schools.  Most of these schools are in rural communities, both small towns and large villages; however, some are located in regional capitals that have populations above 30k. Volunteers will be responsible for different class levels and will teach in classrooms that typically have 50-90 students, often with very limited teaching resources. Many students will be well below the curriculum level; Volunteers must be able to provide differentiated instruction in order to reach both advance and novice learners.  The school system often passes students to the next level, even when students have not passed classes. Volunteers might have to adapt to a system where their grades are good indicators of students progress (or lack thereof), but not be determining factor in a student’s passing. Post encourages volunteers to create secondary projects in youth development.

Gambians are very welcoming and generous.  However, many, especially in the rural areas, have little knowledge of the wider world.  As a result, they often base their assumptions on very stereotypical images.  For example, they may assume that all Asian Americans are of Chinese origin, or that African Americans should understand Gambian culture or even language.  Gambian women, especially in rural areas, have very traditional roles. As a result, North American women may not be able to exercise the freedoms to which they are accustomed.  This being said, most volunteers are able to adapt to local expectations, and are happily integrated into their communities.","Must be able to bicycle long distances,May be challenging for minorities,Uneven terrain,Extreme Heat,Live with homestay family for duration of service","Teacher training or teaching experience preferable.

In 2012, The Gambia Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education entered into a partnership with the New Jersey Center for Teaching and Learning (NJCTL), to pilot a math and science project based on Smartboard technology.  This project started in the urban area, but is now being expanded to up-country schools.  Volunteers support teachers in this initiative, which takes a very different approach to the previous very traditional ""chalk and talk"" teaching in use by most teachers of these subjects.  Volunteers are usually based in a single upper basic or senior secondary school (Grades 7-12), but may work between two or more schools.  They help teachers to adapt to the technology, assist in plannning lessons, observe teaching and give feedback, co-teach and give demonstration lessons.  This is done both individually and in more formal training sessions.  There is support both fom the NJCTL, and from the experienced volunteers who have already worked with the project.  _x000D_

Living with Host Families: PCVs, including couples, will live with host families throughout their training, and for at least the first 3 months once at their permanent sites. Following the first three months at site, PCVs may choose to stay with their host family, or to identify a separate housing option. This may be a room in another family’s home, a connected apartment, or a separate apartment. However, in many remote sites there is often a scarcity of independent housing options, and therefore most PCVs in Georgia live with a host family throughout their service.

Nicaragua’s private, public, and non-profit sectors are concerned about the country’s rapid rate of deforestation and soil erosion that has taken place over the last 25 years. The deforestation is the result of subsistence (slash and burn) farming combined with a growing, market-based agricultural sector, woodcutting and charcoal production to produce traditional fuels. These problems are compounded due to the fact that natural resources are poorly utilized and basic, government-provided services are limited. Community initiatives to address these problems are inhibited by the low income of rural inhabitants and a lack of education related to environmental issues. _x000D_

During PST, Volunteers will stay with a Namibian family for about 8 weeks. Upon swearing in as a Volunteer, every Volunteer will live with a Namibian Host family for their first two months of service at their permanent sites.

Regardless of water availability inside homes, most rural-based volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Volunteers in towns or cities will most likely live in Soviet-era apartment buildings that have not been well maintained cosmetically over the past 30+ years.  They are structurally sound, have electricity, but may lack 24 hr water supply. Bathrooms may or may not have a working shower; in the later case, Volunteers will bathe using bucket baths._x000D_
_x000D_
Winter Heating:  Heating varies from wood or dung burning stoves in rural villages to natural gas heating stoves or central hot water radiated heating systems.  Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system._x000D_
_x000D_
Electricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market._x000D_
_x000D_
Working Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common._x000D_
_x000D_
Roads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi._x000D_
_x000D_
Telecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.  If Trainees want to bring a cell phone, it should be unlocked; rechargeable SIM cards are available at the many branch offices throughout the country.  Unlocked USB modems will also work with the current providers._x000D_
_x000D_
Climate: Armenia has a highland continental climate that enjoys four seasons with short wet springs, dry hot summers, short mild autumns, and very cold winters.  It has various microclimates due to the range of elevations so expect variation from place to place and season to season.  Come prepared with warm clothing and boots for the winter months._x000D_
_x000D_
Armenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat. Women generally wear fashionable clothes and makeup. In the workplace, be it a school, NGO or other institution, PCT/Vs are expected to dress at minimum “business casual” – for men this mean collared shirts, slacks and sport coat, and for women dresses, dress suits, slacks, sweaters, collared shirts, etc. Torn and/or dirty jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, and other casual clothes are not acceptable in the workplace and most social situations.","Other,Uneven terrain,Physically challenging,High altitude,Live with homestay family for duration of service,Isolated site,Long cold winters,May be challenging for minorities","Post prefers trainees with experience and/or educational background in three or more of the following areas: non-profit sector – assessment, board governance, leadership development, strategic planning, project planning and implementation, and community outreach; and/or working with youth in the areas of informal education, summer camps, volunteerism/community service, and life skills development including employability skills._x000D_
_x000D_
The ability to adapt to unfamiliar customs and family norms is an important skill to have or obtain; PCTs will be introduced to customs and norms along with ways to adapt during PST. Armenia is very much a traditional family-centered society with authoritarian/patriarchal leanings and therefore Trainees/Volunteers must have mature interpersonal skills, a willingness to suspend judgment and ability to adapt to local norms and social customs throughout their service._x000D_
_x000D_
Slovenly, disheveled appearance is frowned upon by Armenians and will make it difficult for PCT/Vs to earn respect in their communities._x000D_
_x000D_
Additionally, adoption and adaptation to innovative ideas or new approaches is not readily accepted by most communities. Therefore, the Trainee/Volunteer must have or develop a high degree of patience and be able to tolerate multiple rejections of their suggested ideas or approaches.","Background: Peace Corps began programming in the spring of 1992 at the request of the Government of Armenia to support their efforts to improve the quality of English language education in schools and universities, and assist in the transition to a market-based economy. For nearly two decades, Peace Corps had projects in small business and community development, and in 2012 turned its focus to community and youth development based on a review of country needs and changing priorities aimed at youth. As such, Peace Corps’s Community and Youth Development project (CYD) places Volunteers in communities throughout Armenia to work towards the accomplishment of two goals:_x000D_
_x000D_
Goal 1: Increase the internal capacity and professionalism of organizations_x000D_
Volunteers provide human and institutional capacity development assistance for Armenian organizations to improve their internal governance practices, professionalize outward-focused activities such as marketing and public relations, better assess community issues and develop strategies for their resolution, and utilize local assets and resources to progress toward financial sustainability. Volunteers may find themselves helping an organization improve its human resource management practices by assisting in writing job descriptions and implementing professional development plans for the staff. As well, they assist organizations to improve their planning, implementation, and monitoring & evaluation of community projects._x000D_
_x000D_
Goal 2: Implement programs that lead to positive youth development_x000D_
Through various programs, clubs, and workshops for youth, Peace Corps Volunteers aim to transfer valuable personal and professional skills to Armenia’s youth in order to enhance their capacity as leaders in their communities, promote service-based learning, and assist with career skills development. Volunteers may organize entrepreneurship camps for youth that focus on small-business skills and business plan preparation. They might create after-school activities that teach leadership skills to youth through civic engagement and community development projects. Through leading by example, Peace Corps Volunteers can serve as coaches and mentors for the community youth.",,,,

Attitudes: All YD Volunteers should have a very positive attitude, demonstrate a particular interest in youth culture and be empathetic toward others. They should be self-starters, open minded, friendly,  and persistent in the face of challenges. We expect them to be mature and professional when handling difficult personalities and situations. Furthermore, they should have the ability to work effectively in groups and experience building supportive relationships with vulnerable children and youth.","All YD Volunteers will perform a participatory community diagnostic and will work in the following general project goals:  (1) Healthy Lifestyles and Life Skills (including school drop out prevention, gender and sexual health and alternatives to drug consumption) (2) Youth support (including parent and service providers support for youth) . All assignments have a strong focus on child rights, child protection and prevention activities. _x000D_
_x000D_
Most YD Volunteers will work with individuals (children, youth and parents), service providers (teachers, social workers, psychologists, social promoters, health providers, etc), and organizations (schools, high schools, Child Protection Boards,   regional representatives of the National Child Protection Agency – PANI-, local development associations, and youth groups at the community level, etc).",,,,

Regardless of water availability inside homes, most rural-based volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Volunteers in towns or cities will most likely live in Soviet-era apartment buildings that have not been well maintained cosmetically over the past 30+ years.  They are structurally sound, have electricity, but may lack 24 hr water supply. Bathrooms may or may not have a working shower; in the later case, Volunteers will bathe using bucket baths._x000D_
_x000D_
Winter Heating:  Heating varies from wood or dung burning stoves in rural villages to natural gas heating stoves or central hot water radiated heating systems.  Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system._x000D_
_x000D_
Electricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market._x000D_
_x000D_
Working Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common._x000D_
_x000D_
Roads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi._x000D_
_x000D_
Telecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.  If Trainees want to bring a cell phone, it should be unlocked; rechargeable SIM cards are available at the many branch offices throughout the country.  Unlocked USB modems will also work with the current providers._x000D_
_x000D_
Climate: Armenia has a highland continental climate that enjoys four seasons with short wet springs, dry hot summers, short mild autumns, and very cold winters.  It has various microclimates due to the range of elevations so expect variation from place to place and season to season.  Come prepared with warm clothing and boots for the winter months._x000D_
_x000D_
Armenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat. Women generally wear fashionable clothes and makeup. In the workplace, be it a school, NGO or other institution, PCT/Vs are expected to dress at minimum “business casual” – for men this mean collared shirts, slacks and sport coat, and for women dresses, dress suits, slacks, sweaters, collared shirts, etc. Torn and/or dirty jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, and other casual clothes are not acceptable in the workplace and most social situations.","Uneven terrain,Physically challenging,High altitude,Live with homestay family for duration of service,Isolated site,Long cold winters,May be challenging for minorities","AA162 will work with two partners from Non-governmental Organizations, Community-based Organizations, and/or educational institutions to assist in their organizational development and youth-focused programming.  All Trainees/Volunteers will receive the requisite training for organizational capacity development, and youth development.  Post prefers trainees with experience and/or educational background in three or more of the following areas: non-profit sector – assessment, board governance, leadership development, strategic planning, project planning and implementation, and community outreach; and/or working with youth – informal education, summer camps, volunteerism/community service, and life skills development including employability skills._x000D_
_x000D_
The ability to adapt to unfamiliar customs and family norms is an important skill to have or obtain; PCTs will be introduced to customs and norms along with ways to adapt during PST. Armenia is very much a traditional family-centered society with authoritarian/patriarchal leanings and therefore Trainees/Volunteers must have mature interpersonal skills, a willingness to suspend judgment and ability to adapt to local norms and social customs throughout their service._x000D_
_x000D_
Slovenly, disheveled appearance is frowned upon by Armenians and will make it difficult for PCT/Vs to earn respect in their communities._x000D_
_x000D_
Additionally, adoption and adaptation to innovative ideas or new approaches is not readily accepted by most communities. Therefore, the Trainee/Volunteer must have or develop a high degree of patience and be able to tolerate multiple rejections of their suggested ideas or approaches.","Background: Peace Corps began programming in the spring of 1992 at the request of the Government of Armenia to support their efforts to improve the quality of English language education in schools and universities, and assist in the transition to a market-based economy. For nearly two decades, Peace Corps had projects in small business and community development, and in 2012 turned its focus to community and youth development based on a review of country needs and changing priorities aimed at youth. As such, Peace Corps’s Community and Youth Development project (CYD) places Volunteers in communities throughout Armenia to work towards the accomplishment of two goals:_x000D_
_x000D_
Goal 1: Increase the internal capacity and professionalism of organizations_x000D_
Volunteers provide human and institutional capacity development assistance for Armenian organizations to improve their internal governance practices, professionalize outward-focused activities such as marketing and public relations, better assess community issues and develop strategies for their resolution, and utilize local assets and resources to progress toward financial sustainability. Volunteers may find themselves helping an organization improve its human resource management practices by assisting in writing job descriptions and implementing professional development plans for the staff. As well, they assist organizations to improve their planning, implementation, and monitoring & evaluation of community projects._x000D_
_x000D_
Goal 2: Implement programs that lead to positive youth development_x000D_
Through various programs, clubs, and workshops for youth, Peace Corps Volunteers aim to transfer valuable personal and professional skills to Armenia’s youth in order to enhance their capacity as leaders in their communities, promote service-based learning, and assist with career skills development. Volunteers may organize entrepreneurship camps for youth that focus on small-business skills and business plan preparation. They might create after-school activities that teach leadership skills to youth through civic engagement and community development projects. Through leading by example, Peace Corps Volunteers can serve as coaches and mentors for the community youth.",,,,

Most Volunteers within the CED project will live and work in rural areas of the country in modest living conditions.

While it is very possible to be vegeterian and/or vegan, it will be a challenge and individuals will need to think through their personal strategy to maintain their diet. This also applies to people with special dietary conditions.  In general, Salvadorans eat meat, eggs, and/or dairy at all meals and many deep fried foods.

Regardless of water availability inside homes, most rural-based volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Volunteers in towns or cities will most likely live in Soviet-era apartment buildings that have not been well maintained cosmetically over the past 30+ years.  They are structurally sound, have electricity, but may lack 24 hr water supply. Bathrooms may or may not have a working shower; in the later case, Volunteers will bathe using bucket baths._x000D_
_x000D_
Winter Heating:  Heating varies from wood or dung burning stoves in rural villages to natural gas heating stoves or central hot water radiated heating systems.  Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system._x000D_
_x000D_
Electricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market._x000D_
_x000D_
Working Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common._x000D_
_x000D_
Roads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi._x000D_
_x000D_
Telecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.  If Trainees want to bring a cell phone, it should be unlocked; rechargeable SIM cards are available at the many branch offices throughout the country.  Unlocked USB modems will also work with the current providers._x000D_

Climate: Armenia has a highland continental climate that enjoys four seasons with short wet springs, dry hot summers, short mild autumns, and very cold winters.

Armenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat. Women generally wear fashionable clothes and makeup.

The ability to adapt to unfamiliar customs and family norms is an important skill to have or obtain; PCTs will be introduced to customs and norms along with ways to adapt during PST.

English language learning is a high priority of the South African government to enable students to be successful.  Volunteers are recruited for their interest in directly teaching English during their first year of service to students aged about 10 to 14. During their second year, volunteers may decide to continue teaching and/or add teacher training with the focus on classroom management techniques and student centered teaching methods.

Nicaragua’s private, public, and non-profit sectors are concerned about the country’s rapid rate of deforestation and soil erosion that has taken place over the last 25 years. The deforestation is the result of subsistence (slash and burn) farming combined with a growing, market-based agricultural sector, woodcutting and charcoal production to produce traditional fuels. These problems are compounded due to the fact that natural resources are poorly utilized and basic, government-provided services are limited. Community initiatives to address these problems are inhibited by the low income of rural inhabitants and a lack of education related to environmental issues. _x000D_

The Community Environmental Education Project has a formal agreement with MINED and as partners our organizations have the following framework.  The project''s purpose is: ""To facilitate the sustainable management of communities’ natural resources through education and community action in order to conserve the local environment and improve peoples’ livelihoods."" Community Environmental Education Volunteers will be assigned to work with three local elementary schools. The activities they develop will work towards this purpose by focusing on the following goals:_x000D_
_x000D_
GOAL 1:  Rural school teachers will improve their technical skills to teach environmental education and primary school students will increase their knowledge and skills to conserve natural resources in their communities. _x000D_
_x000D_
Volunteers implement the following tasks to meet this goal:_x000D_
1. Classroom co-teaching: Volunteers demonstrate and model participatory approaches and the inclusion of environmental topics in all courses. Volunteers co-teach in public primary schools, co-plan and train teachers in participatory, community-level environmental activities to achieve this. Methodologies: classroom management, positive reinforcement, community research activities._x000D_

Regardless of water availability inside homes, most rural-based volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Volunteers in towns or cities will most likely live in Soviet-era apartment buildings that have not been well maintained cosmetically over the past 30+ years.  They are structurally sound, have electricity, but may lack 24 hr water supply. Bathrooms may or may not have a working shower; in the later case, Volunteers will bathe using bucket baths._x000D_
_x000D_
Winter Heating:  Heating varies from wood or dung burning stoves in rural villages to natural gas heating stoves or central hot water radiated heating systems.  Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system._x000D_
_x000D_
Electricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market._x000D_
_x000D_
Working Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common._x000D_
_x000D_
Roads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi._x000D_
_x000D_
Telecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.  If Trainees want to bring a cell phone, it should be unlocked; rechargeable SIM cards are available at the many branch offices throughout the country.  Unlocked USB modems will also work with the current providers._x000D_
_x000D_
Climate: Armenia has a highland continental climate that enjoys four seasons with short wet springs, dry hot summers, short mild autumns, and very cold winters.  It has various microclimates due to the range of elevations so expect variation from place to place and season to season.  Come prepared with warm clothing and boots for the winter months._x000D_

Armenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat. Women generally wear fashionable clothes and makeup. In the workplace, be it a school, NGO or other institution, PCT/Vs are expected to dress at minimum “business casual” – for men this mean collared shirts, slacks and sport coat, and for women dresses, dress suits, slacks, sweaters, collared shirts, etc. Torn and/or dirty jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, and other casual clothes are not acceptable in the workplace and most social situations.","Other,Uneven terrain,Physically challenging,High altitude,Live with homestay family for duration of service,Isolated site,Long cold winters,May be challenging for minorities","AA171 focuses on English language instruction in secondary schools; mostly in rural villages.

The ability to adapt to unfamiliar customs and family norms is an important skill to have or obtain; PCTs will be introduced to customs and norms along with ways to adapt during PST.  Armenia is very much a traditional family-centered society with authoritarian/patriarchal leanings and therefore Trainees/Volunteers must have mature interpersonal skills, a willingness to suspend judgment and ability to adapt to local norms and social customs throughout their service._x000D_

Slovenly, disheveled appearance is frowned upon by Armenians and will make it difficult for PCT/Vs to earn respect in their communities._x000D_

Additionally, adoption and adaptation to innovative ideas or new approaches is not readily accepted by most communities.  Therefore, the Trainee/Volunteer must have or develop a high degree of patience and be able to tolerate multiple rejections of their suggested ideas or approaches.","Background: The Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) program was initiated in the spring of 1992 at the request of the Government of Armenia to support their efforts to improve the quality of English language education in schools and universities in order to enhance its participation in the global community.  As such the project works with the Ministry of Education and Science through the National Institute of Education (NIE) to support the English language education strategy. This involves training teachers to use modern English language teaching methodologies and enhancing their English language use in the classroom. The overall purpose of the project is that students and teachers will gain improved access to personal, professional, and academic opportunities through increased English language proficiency. Defined further, the two goals of the Peace Corps’s TEFL project in Armenia are:_x000D_
_x000D_
Goal 1: Teachers will improve their overall level of effectiveness through improving their English language proficiency and implementing student-centered teaching techniques._x000D_

Even in larger towns and cities, they should expect to be subject to frequent, often daily water and power outages.  Rural and small towns have limited means of communication and transportation. Most TEFL sites are in medium to large cities. For many, a challenge will be language development and community integration in large touristed centers. _x000D_

Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL)is Peace Corps Nicaragua’s most recently developed project: Volunteer's primary assignment will be to co-plan and co-teach English classes with 2-3 Nicaraguan English teachers in public high schools. Volunteers can expect to have about 16 teaching hours per week. While in the classroom, Volunteers will be directly working with students, our project is based on building the capacity of each teacher through this unique one-on-one co-teaching relationship. _x000D_

TEFL Volunteers will work with a minimum of two experienced and/or empirical English teachers from one or more schools, primarily co-planning and co-teaching for all classroom hours and providing occasional in-service training to teachers in high schools in current methodologies, subject content and resource development, thus creating sustainable improvements in teaching that will affect generations of future students. Projects include increasing local teacher’s English language competency and conversational skills, organizing teacher associations or training seminars.  Other activities can involve forming English language clubs and resource centers, tutoring at the community level, working with youth and other community outreach activities.  Classroom management, teaching skills, Spanish language skills and community organizing experience strongly preferred._x000D_

English language learning is a high priority of the South African government to enable students to be successful.  Volunteers are recruited for their interest in directly teaching English during their first year of service to students aged about 10 to 14. During their second year, volunteers may decide to continue teaching and/or add teacher training with the focus on classroom management techniques and student centered teaching methods.

The requested Teacher Trainer PCVs will thus play dual roles as(1)English teachers in rural elementary schools (where they will adapt, develop, and field test effective English lessons that flesh out the Ministry's curriculum framework) and (2) resource persons who help Tongan staff develop their ability to use student centered practices (through mentoring, co-teaching, facilitating of workshops, and co-creation of curriculum materials).

Volunteers will teach Chemistry to classes that range in size from 25 to 100 students (average class size is about 40 students).  Volunteers will be expected to prepare lessons in written form in advance for inspection by the school director.  Since students will have almost no access to books, Volunteers will have to prepare notes to be copied from the blackboard.  Chemistry Volunteers will be asked to teach combustion, solubility, concentration, atomic symbols, molecules, periodic table, study of metals, ions, electrolyses, study of gases, syntheses and combustion of water, stoichiometry and redox chemistry, acids and bases, organic chemistry at the lower secondary level (seventh through tenth grades).

Peace Corps Education Volunteers are placed in schools throughout Namibia in all 13 regions of the country.   Peace Corps places Volunteers in either upper primary, junior secondary (middle school) or senior secondary (high school).   Peace Corps Volunteers are placed in a variety of school settings. Some placements may be in schools with few physical resources, in remote settings and with a shortage of qualified teachers. Peace Corps/Namibia also supports schools that are well equipped, but have teacher shortages. They should come prepared to accept either of these assignments.  To ensure sustainability, Peace Corps/Namibia would ideally want each Volunteer to have a counterpart who is teaching the same subject as them.  However, due to the shortage of teachers, they might find themselves teaching without a counterpart._x000D_

Peace Corps is a 24/7 job. This means that their role as a Peace Corps Volunteer does not end when they leave work for the day.  As a “cultural ambassador”, their off-hours and free time still carry the burden and blessing of their commitment to service.

Electricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.

Roads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi._x000D_

Telecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.

The Gambia is conservative by U.S. standards, and many Gambians disapprove of homosexuality. Because of this, gay, lesbian, and bisexual volunteers have not been able to be open about their sexual orientation. However, Peace Corps The Gambia provides an open and supportive atmosphere for gay, lesbian, and bisexual volunteers. Gambians are very welcoming and generous. However, many, especially in the rural areas, have little knowledge of the wider world. As a result, they often base their assumptions on very stereotypical images. For example, they may assume that all Asian Americans are of Chinese origin, or that African Americans should understand Gambian culture or even language. Gambian women, especially in rural areas, have very traditional roles. As a result, North American women may not be able to exercise the freedoms to which they are accustomed. This being said, most volunteers are able to adapt to local expectations, and are happily integrated into their communities.","Must be able to bicycle long distances,May be challenging for minorities,Uneven terrain,Extreme Heat,Live with homestay family for duration of service,Isolated site","A broad range of backgrounds are accepted; good knowledge of a range of community health issues, high resiliency skills and/or some life experience showing ability to achieve in difficult circumstances, will be much appreciated_x000D_

Most Volunteers use an outdoor pit latrine and fetch water from a stand pipe in their home compound or from a village pump a few yards from their house.
